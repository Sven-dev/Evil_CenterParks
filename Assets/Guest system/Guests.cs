{

/*
>Guest arrives, causes buzzer noise + starts "guest satisfaction" timer, acts as a hard timer
>>Guests may have differing personalities causing changes to the situation 
>>(I.e; Having the radio on making the timer go faster, not giving you all the information w/o being asked, Flat out lying to you to try and get in)

>Player presses button to let them in, "unlocking" the door to their right, "locking" the door to their left
>>This causes a passive power increase acting as a soft timer

>Guest gives player their Name, Reference number, room number and the range of dates they are staying
>>Player must then check if the given information is correct on their computer, which has a guest list available, if correct the guest may enter, if false the guest must leave

>Player prints a map for the guest, which "guides them to their room" and hands them a key
>>Player can grant the wrong key in order to guide the guest a certain way, causing a slight bump in dissatisfaction & having to explain why this is.

>Guests must have a reference number to gain access to their room, thus guests that lie to get in cannot access their room, and are free to be killed by the entities, causing a bloodlust event.
